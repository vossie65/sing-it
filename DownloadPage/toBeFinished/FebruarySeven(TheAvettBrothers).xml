      <lyrics>
        <line>I went on the search for something true</line>
        <line>I was almost there when I found you</line>
        <line>Sooner than my fate was wrote</line>
        <line>A perfect blade, it slit my throat</line>
        <line>And beads of lust, released into the air</line>
        <line>When I awoke you were standing there</line>
        <line></line>
        <line>I was on the mend when I fell through</line>
        <line>The sky around was anything but blue</line>
        <line>I found as I regained my feet, a wound across my memory</line>
        <line>That no amount of stitches would repair</line>
        <line>But I awoke and you were standing there</line>

      <lyrics>
        <line>There's no fortune at the end of a road</line>
        <line>That has no end</line>
        <line>There's no returning to the spoils</line>
        <line>Once you've spoiled the thought of them</line>
        <line>There's no falling back to sleep</line>
        <line>Once you've awakened from the dream</line>
        <line>Now I'm rested and I'm ready</line>
        <line>I'm rested and I'm ready to begin</line>
        <line>I'm ready to begin</line>

        <line>I went on the search for something real</line>
        <line>Traded what I know for how I feel</line>
        <line>But the ceiling and the walls collapsed</line>
        <line>Upon the darkness I was trapped</line>
        <line>And as the last of breath was drawn from me</line>
        <line>Light broke in and brought me to my feet</line>
        <line></line>
