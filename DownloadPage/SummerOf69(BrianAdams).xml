        <line>I got my first real six-string</line>
        <line>Bought it at the five-and-dime</line>
        <line>Played it till my fingers bled</line>
        <line>Was the summer of '69</line>
        <line>Me and some guys from school</line>
        <line>Had a band and we tried real hard</line>
        <line>Jimmy quit, Jody got married</line>
        <line>Shoulda known, we'd never get far</line>

        <line>Oh when I look back now</line>
        <line>That summer seemed to last forever</line>
        <line>And if I had the choice</line>
        <line>Yeah, I'd always want to be there</line>
        <line>Those were the best days of my life</line>

        <line>Ain't no use in complainin'</line>
        <line>When you got a job to do</line>
        <line>Spent my evenings down at the drive-in</line>
        <line>And that's when I met you</line>

        <line>Standin' on your mama's porch</line>
        <line>You told me that you'd wait forever</line>
        <line>Oh and when you held my hand</line>
        <line>I knew that it was now or never</line>
        <line>Those were the best days of my life</line>
        <line>Oh yeah</line>
        <line>Back in the summer of '69</line>

        <line>Man we were killin' time</line>

        <line>We needed to unwind</line>
        <line>I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no</line>

        <line>Sometimes when I play that old six-string</line>
        <line>Think about you wonder what went wrong</line>
